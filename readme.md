## Overview

This project is a Django application designed to [**Describe the project's purpose here.  E.g., manage user accounts, provide a REST API for a mobile app, etc.**]. It utilizes PostgreSQL as its database backend, Swagger (and ReDoc) for interactive API documentation, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

*   **Python:** Version 3.8 or later.  (Recommended to use the latest stable version)
*   **PostgreSQL:** Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system.
*   **pip:** Python package installer (usually included with Python).

You'll also need the following Python packages, which will be installed during the installation process:

*   Django
*   Django REST Framework
*   drf-yasg
*   djangorestframework-simplejwt
*   psycopg2-binary

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [**YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL**]
    cd [**YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY**]  # Replace with your project's directory name
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   **Linux/macOS:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    *   **Windows:**

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Recommended - creates a requirements.txt file

    # OR install individually:
    pip install django djangorestframework drf-yasg djangorestframework-simplejwt psycopg2-binary
    ```
    **Note:** If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file (you should generate one after installing your requirements - `pip freeze > requirements.txt`), use the second method to install them individually.

5.  **Create the PostgreSQL database:**

    Connect to your PostgreSQL server (e.g., using `psql`) and create the database and user:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE [**YOUR_DATABASE_NAME**];
    CREATE USER [**YOUR_DATABASE_USER**] WITH PASSWORD '[**YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD**]';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE [**YOUR_DATABASE_NAME**] TO [**YOUR_DATABASE_USER**];
    ```

    **Important:** Replace `[**YOUR_DATABASE_NAME**]`, `[**YOUR_DATABASE_USER**]`, and `[**YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD**]` with your desired database name, username, and password.  Use a strong password!

## Configuration

1.  **Configure Database Settings:**

    Open your Django project's `settings.py` file (usually located at `[**YOUR_PROJECT_NAME**]/settings.py`) and modify the `DATABASES` setting to match your PostgreSQL configuration:

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': config('DATABASE_NAME'),
            'USER': config('DATABASE_USER'),
            'PASSWORD': config('DATABASE_PASSWORD'),
            'HOST': config('DATABASE_HOST', default='localhost'),
            'PORT': config('DATABASE_PORT', default='5432'),
        }
    }
    ```

    Replace the bracketed placeholders with the appropriate values you used in the database creation step.

2.  **Configure JWT settings (Optional but Recommended):**

   In `settings.py` add this section:

   ```python
    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    ),
    }

    SIMPLE_JWT = {
        'ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(minutes=30), # adjust as needed
        'REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=1), # adjust as needed
    }
    ```
Use code with caution.
Markdown
adjust the ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME and REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME as per your requirement.

Configure Allowed Hosts

In settings.py add your localhost in the ALLOWED_HOSTS section if you are using it locally:

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost']
Use code with caution.
Python
If you are deploying, make sure to add the domain of the deployed application.

Run Migrations:

Apply the database migrations to create the necessary tables:

python manage.py migrate
Use code with caution.
Bash
Create Superuser:

Create a superuser account for administrative access:

python manage.py createsuperuser
Use code with caution.
Bash
Follow the prompts to enter a username, email address, and password.

Running the Project
To start the Django development server, run the following command:

python manage.py runserver
Use code with caution.
Bash
This will start the server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (or another available port if 8000 is already in use). Open this address in your web browser to access your application.

API Documentation
The project provides interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc. You can access them at:

Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/

ReDoc: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc/

These interfaces allow you to explore the available API endpoints, send requests, and view responses. drf-yasg generates these views based on your API definitions.

JWT Authentication
This project utilizes JWT for user authentication. Here's how to use it:

Obtain a Token:

Send a POST request to the token endpoint (typically /api/token/ or similar) with your username and password in the request body (usually in JSON format).

Example (using curl):

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "[**YOUR_USERNAME**]", "password": "[**YOUR_PASSWORD**]"}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/
Use code with caution.
Bash
The response will contain access and refresh tokens.

Authenticate Requests:

Include the access token in the Authorization header of your requests to protected API endpoints. Use the Bearer scheme:

Authorization: Bearer [**YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN**]
Use code with caution.
Example (using curl):

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [**YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN**]" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/protected-endpoint/
Use code with caution.
Bash
Token Refresh (if applicable):

If you have configured refresh tokens, use the refresh token endpoint (typically /api/token/refresh/ or similar) to get a new access token when your current one expires.

Common Issues and Solutions
psycopg2 Installation Errors:

If you encounter issues installing psycopg2, ensure that you have the necessary PostgreSQL development libraries installed on your system. The exact package name varies depending on your operating system (e.g., libpq-dev on Debian/Ubuntu, postgresql-devel on Fedora/CentOS). If you are still having problems try pip install --no-cache-dir psycopg2-binary.

Permission denied for schema public:

This error indicates that the database user you're using doesn't have sufficient privileges. Connect to your PostgreSQL database as a superuser and grant the necessary privileges:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO [**YOUR_DATABASE_USER**];
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE [**YOUR_DATABASE_NAME**] TO [**YOUR_DATABASE_USER**];
Use code with caution.
SQL
Replace [**YOUR_DATABASE_USER**] and [**YOUR_DATABASE_NAME**] with your database username and database name, respectively.

Use code with caution.
